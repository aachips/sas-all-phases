          <h1 class="post-title">Welcome to the Apple Chip Blog</h1>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I'm really glad you showed up. Sorry for being distant these past years. If you know me, this is a good place to find me. If you don't, it's nice to meet you. Make yourself at home. Here is a bit of an orientation:</p>
            <p>My name is April. All the pronouns are fine, but try out the singular they when referring to me. She's endearing. He only if I am in trouble.</p> 

            <p>I'd like to make the world a safer, more humane, and sustainable place. We are in the 11th hour. It's not looking great. It's not my intention or place to bog you down with depressing news stories. Sometimes I do that anyways. Since going back to school, I've formally gotten into Computer Technology and learned to code. I wanted to find ways to better deliver helpful content in a way large social media sites make it difficult to do.</p>
            <p>I really want this to be a place you enjoy being at. Write down the link somewhere or bookmark if you'd like. Some of the subjects that you can find here are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sustainability</li>
                <li>Global Conflicts</li>
                <li>Human Services</li>
                <li>Behavioral Psychology</li>
                <li>Earth Sciences</li>
                <li>Food and Cooking</li>
                <li>Judeo-Spanish</li>
                <li>Safeguarding Young Adults</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Sometimes I dabble with Artificial Intelligence. This is to explore ways we can collaborate with Computers to improve the world.</p>
            <p>I may have paid sponsors in the future. The condition is that they be businesses and organizations consistent with the values of this site. Projects that are worth sharing with others. </p>
            <p>But in general, I want this project to be independently funded. You can help out with that by making a recurring, or one time donation to my Kofi. There may be a list of rewards in the future for contributions, but if you donate before then, you'll be the first in line for goodies later on. ðŸ˜€</p>
            <p>In short, I make cool snacks, and publish cool facts. Both of these are referred to as 'Chips.' Content Chips I think of as similar to web-page Cookies. Cookies are used to track user information of visitors to a web page. Cookies are not about tracking, but are text files containing interesting facts that you can download and put on your device.</p>
            <p>These could be writings, funny memes, articles published elsewhere. There could be simple games on them, or puzzles, or songs and stories. And you can have hundreds, if not thousands of these on your device available offline. It's a different way we could use computers and the internet.</p>
            <p>There may be content with adult themes. Or distressing content. I'll provide content warnings. </p>
            <p>Please leave a comment if you'd like. I'd really enjoy that. Even if it's to tell me I'm a big jerk-head.</p>
            <p>If I blew you off and disappeared. I'm really sorry. It's not personal, it's Avoidant Personality Disorder. I'll likely be glad to hear from you. And if not I'll still respond. Pardon if it's a little snarky. You're welcome here.</p>
