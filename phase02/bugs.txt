I have two bugs on Phase02. The first is that Create and Edit links do not display a page. This is probably fine at this stage. The other bug is that Github is a little more difficult to point the right way and are using the command line. For now, I manually uploaded all the files onto the repository. When I attempt to open the remote repository in VScode.dev, it doesn't work. I think this is a VScode bug on their browser version. These bugs are very likely bugs in April's brain, and not in the software.
